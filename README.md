# Competidor
<h1>There are some random things... Nevermind</h1>  
At <a href="/Old%20versions">Old versions</a> we can find some CRUD testing, where "Competidor" folder (not "Competidor3") should have the latest version of it, it has some bugs, just a testing project, DB script is not uploaded.<br>  
At <a href="/ControlVersiones">ControlVersiones</a> are located more testing projects. Which are (almost) realtime uploaded form work-flow.
